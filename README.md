If you are a musician, you know that the more songs you learn - the more songs you forget... which can be quite frustrating.

Songs-I-Know is a digital solution to this issue: a place for musicians to easily keep track of all the songs they learn over the years.

This will primarily be a back-end project. Making the "CRUD'ing" aspect easy for our musician users will be important, so we will be utilize the Django framework (known for its approachability and scaleability).

For each song title a user CRUD's, there will be an option to include Youtube (or other video) tutorials, tabs (sheet music), custom notes, and a relative scale of how much they have "mastered" that song (1-5).
